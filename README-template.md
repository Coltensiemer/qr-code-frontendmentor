### What I learned

This was a great way for me to start learning react-app. I also included to build with tailwind. 

One important part that I looked at was to learn accessibility with this project. As simple as it was, I learn that between text-fonts and backgrounds there needs to be a certain contrast. 

I used Depue tools to check for accessibilty. This really helped me make sure I was using best practices
